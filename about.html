          My websites are created with goals in mind,
          be that to increase exposure, generate new customers, or sell products.
          I prefer a clean professional approach that maintains your brand without distraction.
          Custom graphic design is also available, including logos and decorative art.
          Lets work together to create websites that are seamlessly efficient yet beautifully memorable.

        <p>
          I create static websites that have all the functionality of
          advanced back end systems. This is achieved with the JAMstack,
          a new web architecture that combines the speed and security of static page loads
          with the precision solutions of external APIs.
          Basically this allows me to give you what's important
          without sacrificing speed, security or stability.

        <p>
          Every page I create is designed with mobile
          and tablet in mind.
          Given that over 51% of internet traffic originates from mobile, and that this
          trend is not set to decrease anytime soon. Updating websites to meet
          the global requirements is a vital aspect of any modern business.
          My mobile designs offer totally unique responsive experiences.
          This guarantees customer engagement regardless of how they access the site.

      <div class="text editable"><h2>SEO</h2><p>What's the point of a website if nobody can see it? Search Engine Optimisation is the art of making websites visible to online search engines such as Google. This is difficult, and highly competitive. Every page I design is optimised to give you the edge over your opponents. I also offer content creation, and google adword strategies to increase your online presence. If required I can also provide analytics to help gain invaluable data on your customers.</p></div>

    <h2>
      Hosting
    </h2>
    <p>
      For most sites I provide hassle free hosting for a nominal monthly fee.
      This includes access to an user-friendly content editor, allowing you to upload images
      and text simpily whenever you desire. Access is restricted so that it's impossible to ruin the
      overall flow of the webpage. I host sites using a combination of Github, Cloudcannon and Amazon Web Services.
      This means your webpage is automatically distributed globally, giving customers faster access even in low connectivity.
      This setup is highly scalable, meaning your webpage can grow as your busniess does.
