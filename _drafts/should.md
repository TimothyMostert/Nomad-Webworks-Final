You know your business needs a website, but whether you try and tackle it yourself, or hire a professional can prove a difficult decision. The good news is both solutions work, it just depends on your priorities. Let's compare popular online services such as Weebly, Wix and Squarespace with professional web developers.

## Advantages of Website Builders

1. They are free! lets not kid ourselves, this is the main reason this dilemma even exists. Besides the cost of purchasing a professional theme or plugin, you can have your site up and running without touching the bank. Perfect for small budgets and personal projects.
2. They are easy to use... initially. Quickly starting a site can take a matter of seconds. After that adding new text, images and even plugins can be done with the click of a button. It's only once you need to do something beyond the scope of the tutorial, that one realises the hidden learning curve involved.
3. There have large and active communities. If you get stuck with an issue or need a specific problem solved with a plugin, it's likely someone else has been there before. Resources and solutions will be available online to help you get through it.

## **Advantages of website Designers**

1. They do everything for you! Even with an online tool, making a website is a time consuming process. This only gets harder as the needs of your site increase. Time is your most valuable resource, and outsourcing the work can save you 10's of hours. Giving you an opportunity to allocate those resources elsewhere.
2. They make superior websites. Web designers have spent years learning how to best optimise their webpages, They know what works. From load speeds, to user design and layout; a custom website will always out perform a packaged product if made correctly. This is especially relevant for search engine optimisation (the art of being seen on google), and becomes even more important as your site scales in traffic. They are also more secure, as they don't rely on bulky and easily hack-able code.
3. They offer total customisation. While builders allow you to quickly open a template and fill out some content, they look generic. Designers take your specific needs into consideration and create sites that help you differentiate your business or product. No matter what your goal or brand identity, a developer with the right skill can craft a solution for you.

## Which is Best for You

If you need a simple webpage, and have the free time to spend learning and creating it, using a website builder can be a decent solution. Most importantly it's free, but besides that its gives you easy access to features that are complex to create manually, and there are large communities that help you work on the site. It is quick to start, and easy to create a simple site so long as you don't mind it looking pretty generic.

On the other hand a website designer might be a better choice if you care about any of the following criteria:

* you're busy and need the website made without hassle.
* you require a unique design that separates itself from the limited templates online.
* your business exists in a competitive field where you need every advantage in order to be seen on google over your competitors.
* your customers might be sensitive to slow page speeds, or frequently experience bad connectivity.
* you process a large amount of customers or expect your business to scale rapidly in the future.
* you want your website to last longer, without experiencing the security risks that are innately built into older versions of website builders.

Hopefully this comparison helps you in making a decision. Remember, it all boils down to what you require. Do you need a website that "gets the job done", and have some time to fiddle around, a website builder is the choice for you. &nbsp;Otherwise if you require higher standards and customisation a web designer is the better option.
