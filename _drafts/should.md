You know your business needs a website, but whether you try and tackle it yourself, or hire a professional can prove a difficult decision. The good news is both solutions work, it just depends on your priorities. Let's compare popular online services such as Weebly, Wix and Squarespace with professional web developers.

## Advantages of Website Builders

1. They are free! lets not kid ourselves, this is the main reason this dilemma even exists. Besides the cost of purchasing a professional theme or plugin, you can have your site up and running without touching the bank. Perfect for small budgets and personal projects.
2. They are easy to use... initially. Quickly starting a site can take a matter of seconds. After that adding new text, images and even plugins can be done with the click of a button. It's only once you need to do something beyond the scope of the tutorial, that one realises the hidden learning curve involved.
3. There have large and active communities. If you get stuck with an issue or need a specific problem solved with a plugin, it's likely someone else has been there before. Resources and solutions will be available online to help you get through it.
